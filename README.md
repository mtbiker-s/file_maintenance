# file_maintenance.py
A Python3 program that allows you to do maintenance on files and directories.
It provides a way to Rename, Move or Delete files

## Why
Because I got tired of doing rm, cp and mv. Don't take it wrong I love those commands from the cli but when it comes to doing file maintenance on some files and directories, It got pretty intensive and repetative. So being a nerd, I wrote a program to help me do this stuff.

## If you're here
Please feel free to use it, tweak it, make it your own.

### Enjoy
